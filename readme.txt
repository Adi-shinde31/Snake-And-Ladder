Aditya (27/10) :
-> #define default windows width & height as constant @ line 10, 11
-> Used while loop for printing number and reversed all even lines.
-> "outstreamxy(100, 100);" will set the coordinates and start printing from there.
-> "bgiout" will help to print on output screen just like "cout"
